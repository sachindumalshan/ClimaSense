ClimaSense is a compact weather station monitoring system that utilizes real-time updates through IoT technology. I employed the WOKWI online electronics simulator for simulation, and the data was then transmitted to the ThingSpeak platform for monitoring purposes.

üß© Key Components:
- Raspberry Pi Pico
- DHT22 Sensor
- Light Sensor
- DHT11 Sensor

üí° What Can ClimaSense Do?
- ClimaSense integrates with the two sensors and it connects to the internet and user can monitor the status of the weather. And also it powered by using Raspberry Pi Pico computer and also the ThingSpeak IoT platform.

üå°Ô∏è Temperature Monitoring:
- The DHT22 sensor in your weather station provides accurate real-time temperature data, ensuring you stay informed about the current climate conditions.

üíß Humidity Monitoring:
Integrated with your weather station, the DHT22 sensor delivers reliable humidity readings, essential for understanding moisture levels in the air.

‚òÄÔ∏è Light Sensor Monitoring:
Enhancing your weather station, the Light sensor measures light intensity, helping you gauge brightness levels in your surroundings.<be>
